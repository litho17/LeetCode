# LeetCode solutions (in Java)

## About

This repo contains my thoughts and solutions to the problems in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## Motivation

My motivations of maintaining this repo are to

### Improve skills

- Improve my problem-solving skills, i.e.
  1. Understand a problem
  2. Come up with one or more brute-force solution(s)
  3. Optimize the brute-force solution(s)
  4. Ultimate goal: Design **simple, correct and fast** algorithms
- Improve my coding skills, i.e. implement robust programs

### Research

- Apply my program analysis skills and Discover program analysis insights
  - i.e. Summarize and generalize different approaches of reasoning about a program
- Do something meaningful apart from my research
  - It is sometimes not efficient to focus on only one task at a time
  - Solving LeetCode problems is actually no different than doing research, because the goals of both are to **solve problems**

### Change mindset

- Turn my mindset of working on LeetCode problems from being task-oriented (and one-off) into being explorative and thoughtful (and long-term)
  - Thus being more entertaining to myself
  - I love thinking about a problem in depth (i.e. **generalize/abstract** it) and breadth (i.e. understand its **connection** with other problems)
- Motivate and enforce myself to keep working on LeetCode problems by sharing my progress in a **public and competitive** environement
- Isn't it nice that I do not have to **discover** a problem, but that someone has **assigned** me a problem?
- My job is to come up with a **perfect** solution

### Sharing

- Keep my draft solutions (i.e. work in progress)
- Share my thoughts with others
